# The Final Project

## Part 1 - Vigenère Cracker

Write a script to input a Vigenère-encrypted ciphertext and print the plaintext and key. Find out how to perform cryptanalysis on the Vignère cipher using Google or elsewhere.

### Constraints
The input ciphertext will only contain lower case letters, spaces and punctuations. The spaces and punctuations are not encrypted. The key length would be less than or equal to 12 characters. You may use Python, C or C++ to write your script.

### Verifying your solution
You can use [these three sample test cases](./samples.txt) to verify your code. 

### Submission instruction
Create a file `script.py`/`script.c`/`script.cpp` which solves the challenge. Create a README file with clear instructions on how to execute your script.

### Submission Link
Add all files related to your project submission in a public GitHub repository or a publicly viewable Google Drive Folder. Submit the link to the GitHub repository or Google Drive Folder here: https://forms.gle/KCgXNanqxDV5n1LY9
